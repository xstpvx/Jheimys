## Children's Boutique
### **Created by Sheily Perez**

#### Overview:

##### This is an online page for a children's clothing store located in Santo Domingo Este.

* This store will commence as a virtual store, thus it needs a strong social media presence. The variety of newborn, toddler, pre teen, teen clothing in the Dominican Republic lacks greatly, most seek outside of the country for clothing needs, but shipping is both expensive and unreliable. This will be a one stop shop for all.

* Items of both sexes will be sold. Accessories, school uniforms, shoes,  eye/sun glasses, will be part of the itinerary. 

#### Goal:
Target the lack of clothing options in the country.

#### Target Audience:
We will be targeting all those that use social media and look for different options for the kids clothing needs. 


#### Technologies to be used:

##### Front End: 	

* HTML

* CSS

* Bootstrap
